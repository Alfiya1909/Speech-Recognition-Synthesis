# Speech-Recognition-Synthesis

Designed and developed a full-stack web application that leverages machine learning for real-time speech recognition, text-to-speech synthesis, youtube transcription and multilingual translation. Key features include:

Live Speech-to-Text (STT) using OpenAI Whisper and Wav2Vec for accurate transcription.

Text-to-Speech (TTS) generation powered by Hugging Face's SpeechT5 for natural voice output.

Voice Command Integration enabling users to navigate the app and perform actions through customizable commands.

YouTube Transcription functionality that allows users to extract and transcribe audio from YouTube videos.

Multilingual Support with automatic language detection and translation using Google Cloud Translation API.

User Management System with secure registration, login, and activity logging using Django and SQLite.

Built with Django (backend), HTML/CSS/JavaScript (frontend), and PyTorch for ML components.

This project demonstrates the integration of cutting-edge ML models into a user-friendly web interface, enabling seamless voice-based interaction, transcription, and translation.
